After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin with a B.A. in Natural Science in 2012, I undertook a Ph.D. in Genetics in the [McLysaght Lab](http://www.gen.tcd.ie/molevol/) studying the evolution of human dosage-sensitive genes.

More recently, in the [Hurst Lab](https://people.bath.ac.uk/bssldh/LaurenceDHurst/Home.html), Iâ€™ve been exploring factors influencing the important relationship between genomic context and gene expression, specifically how neighbouring genes have more similar expression profiles.

I have communicated my research to diverse audiences, from secondary school students with Junior Certificate/GCSE-level knowledge, to peers in my field at international conferences.
