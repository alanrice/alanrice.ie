I was having trouble spotting typos in my writing and remembered coming across this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/), which had the suggestion "Change the font or background color, or print it out and edit by hand" to make typos easier to find.

So I made a webpage that randomises the font for each sentence of text pasted into a textbox.

Available at [alanrice.github.io/typo-crusher/](http://alanrice.github.io/typo-crusher/)

Makes use of Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Font API, and Lo-Dash.
