I became frustrated when shopping for greetings cards at the lack of LGBTQ+ representation and decided to make a small site to list inclusive sources that I came across for future reference. I hope that it's a useful resource for more than just myself.

The original Twitter thread where I outlined some of the reasons for my frustration and shared the link for the first time:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi kitty cats!<br>Can we take a moment to talk about greeting cards and why card shopping as a queer person is the WORST?<br>So every christmas/birthday/whatever it&#39;s always difficult to find a card that expresses affection but does so without being super heteronormative.</p>&mdash; Alan Rice (@alanmrice) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanmrice/status/1099656211291688964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After you get past gross stereotypes of men only being into sport &amp; alcohol, you reach cards that are (not so) subtly from one gender to the opposite. When you exclude all those, the ones that remain just aren&#39;t very affectionate. You reach a point where you have 4 options left:</p>&mdash; Alan Rice (@alanmrice) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanmrice/status/1099656213510475782?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) Generically nice typography saying &quot;Merry and Bright&quot;, and works equally well as the card your Christmas bonus One4All voucher comes in from your employer.<br>2) &quot;Happy Christmas to my significant other&quot;, which is not how most humans I know talk to well, their significant other.</p>&mdash; Alan Rice (@alanmrice) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanmrice/status/1099656215066525696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3) Illustrated cards, like cuddly Hallmark bears with cute faces.
